💡 Problem Statement

The assignment focuses on **customer segmentation** and predictive modeling to derive meaningful insights from the provided dataset. The objective is to build an efficient pipeline to:
- Analyze customer behavior.
- Cluster similar customers based on their attributes.
- Provide actionable insights for business decision-making.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

This project leverages the following tools and libraries:
- Programming Language: Python 🐍
- Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, KMeans
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Interactive Dashboards: Dash, Plotly

🔍 Key Features

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize and scale features for optimal model performance.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Generate insightful visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.

3. Customer Segmentation:
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans) to group customers effectively.
   - Evaluate cluster quality using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index.

4. Visualization:
   - Interactive 3D plots using Plotly for intuitive analysis.
   - Pairwise scatterplots with Seaborn for deeper insights.

5. Actionable Insights:
   - Recommendations based on clustering results to enhance customer engagement.
